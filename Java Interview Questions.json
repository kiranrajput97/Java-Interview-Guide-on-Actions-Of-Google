            {
              "textToSpeech": "Q: Why Java is considered dynamic?\n A: It is designed to adapt to an evolving environment. Java programs can carry extensive amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects on run-time."
            },
            {
              "textToSpeech": "Q: What is Java Virtual Machine and how it is considered in context of Java’s platform independent feature?\n A: When Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run."
            },
            {

            {
              "textToSpeech": "Q: What do you mean by Constructor?\n A: Constructor gets invoked when a new object is created. Every class has a constructor. If we do not explicitly write a constructor for a class the java compiler builds a default constructor for that class."
            },
            {
              "textToSpeech": "Q: List the three steps for creating an Object for a class?\n A: An Object is first declared, then instantiated and then it is initialized."

            {
              "textToSpeech": "Q: Why is String class considered immutable?\n A: The String class is immutable, so that once it is created a String object cannot be changed. Since String is immutable it can safely be shared between many threads ,which is considered very important for multithreaded programming."
            },
            {
              "textToSpeech": "Q: Why is StringBuffer called mutable?\n A: The String class is considered as immutable, so that once it is created a String object cannot be changed. If there is a necessity to make alot of modifications to Strings of characters then StringBuffer should be used."

            {
              "textToSpeech": "Q: What do you mean by Checked Exceptions?\n A: It is an exception that is typically a user error or a problem that cannot be foreseen by the programmer. For example, if a file is to be opened, but the file cannot be found, an exception occurs. These exceptions cannot simply be ignored at the time of compilation."
            },
            {
              "textToSpeech": "Q: Explain Runtime Exceptions?\n A: It is an exception that occurs that probably could have been avoided by the programmer. As opposed to checked exceptions, runtime exceptions are ignored at the time of compliation."

            },
            {
              "textToSpeech": "Q: When throws keyword is used?\n A: If a method does not handle a checked exception, the method must declare it using the throwskeyword. The throws keyword appears at the end of a method's signature."
            },
            {
              "textToSpeech": "Q: When throw keyword is used?\n A: An exception can be thrown, either a newly instantiated one or an exception that you just caught, by using throw keyword."
            },
            {
              "textToSpeech": "Q: How finally used under Exception Handling?\n A: The finally keyword is used to create a block of code that follows a try block. A finally block of code always executes, whether or not an exception has occurred."

              "textToSpeech": "Q: Define Inheritance?\n A: It is the process where one object acquires the properties of another. With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order."
            },
            {
              "textToSpeech": "Q: When super keyword is used?\n A: If the method overrides one of its superclass's methods, overridden method can be invoked through the use of the keyword super. It can be also used to refer to a hidden field"
            },
            {
              "textToSpeech": "Q: What is Polymorphism?\n A: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object."

            },
            {
              "textToSpeech": "Q: When Abstract methods are used?\n A: If you want a class to contain a particular method but you want the actual implementation of that method to be determined by child classes, you can declare the method in the parent class as abstract."
            },
            {
              "textToSpeech": "Q: What is Encapsulation?\n A: It is the technique of making the fields in a class private and providing access to the fields via public methods. If a field is declared private, it cannot be accessed by anyone outside the class, thereby hiding the fields within the class. Therefore encapsulation is also referred to as data hiding."
            },
            {
              "textToSpeech": "Q: What is the primary benefit of Encapsulation?\n A: The main benefit of encapsulation is the ability to modify our implemented code without breaking the code of others who use our code.

              "textToSpeech": "Q: How do you decide when to use ArrayList and LinkedList?\n A: If you need to frequently add and remove elements from the middle of the list and only access the list elements sequentially, then LinkedList should be used. If you need to support random access, without inserting or removing elements from any place other than the end, then ArrayList should be used."
